## Original Source Data (via CSU Chico Instituional Research)
* Course Detail.csv
  - n = 43,803
  - Row contains record for course sections from Fall 2012 to Winter 2022
* Student Profile Metric.csv
  - n = 49,107
  - Row contains one record per student matriculation for students enrolled from Fall 2012 to Spring 2022
* Student Program.csv
  - n = 343,781
  - Row contains records for each semester of each student's attendance who were enrolled from Fall 2012 to Winter 2022
  
## Original Source Datasets (acquired via CSU Cico Instituional Research)
* SLC Appointment.csv
  - n = 78,229
  - Row contains record for each day that a student went to an SI session, and how many they went to in that day (Fall 2015 - Spring 2022)
* Student Grade.xlsx
  - n = 864,471
  - Row contains final grade data earned for each course for each student from Fall 2016 to Winter 2022
  
## Data Preparation
### Student Level Analysis (n = 20,562)
* Only student records dated 2016 or later
* Best attempt at isolating most recent student program record
* Approximately 35% of students in the programs dataset are not present in the profiles dataset. Therefore, these records have missing data for HS/Transfer GPA, one-year retention, and matriculation/graduation terms
* Records with missing data for the following attributes were dropped:
  - High School GPA
  - Attended Orientation Flag
  - STEM Major Flag
  - Full Time / Part Time Code
  - Academic Program

## Data Preparation
### Course Level Analysis (n = 5,637)
* Includes class size, average high school GPA, % first-gen in the class, % URM in the class, DWF rate, SI component flag, term year
  - These were calculated using the grades data provided by IR
  - Students with missing records for high school GPA were not included in the calculation
  - Students with missing records for URM and first-gen status were considered as not a member of these groups
* Course records from 2016-2019
* Course sections with less than 10 records of an SI visit during the semester were considered as sections without an SI-component
* Courses represented have a number less than 300 and are not a special number (x89, x99, etc.)
* To remove high calculated DWF outliers, class size >= 20

## Data Preparation
### Coarsened Exact Matching Analysis (n = 11,166)
* Student profiles, programs, and grades with course level information for courses with SI
* Only student records dated 2016 to 2019 who DID NOT DROP
* Best attempt at isolating most recent student program record
* Approximately 35% of students in the programs dataset are not present in the profiles dataset. Therefore, these records have missing data for HS/Transfer GPA, one-year retention, and matriculation/graduation terms
* Records with missing data for the following attributes were dropped:
  - High School GPA
  - Attended Orientation Flag
  - STEM Major Flag
  - Full Time / Part Time Code
  - Academic Program
  
# Student Level Analysis 

- Measuring student level equity gaps
  - Students who under represented minorities 
  - Students who are first generation
- Measuring success
  - One-year retention

# Student Level Analysis: Modeling 

- Logistic regression 
- Explanatory variables:
  - Student characteristics: URM, First Generation, Gender, Stem Major, number of units taken in the semester, number of units passed in the semester, Cohort term year, SI attendance 
  - Course characteristics: Academic level, Course fee existence, GE class 
- Primary variables of interest: SI and the interaction between SI the measures of equity
