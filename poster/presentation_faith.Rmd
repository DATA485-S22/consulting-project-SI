# Definitions

Two common measurements universities use to identify historically underserved students are underrepresented minority and first generation.

- **Underrepresented Minority (URM)** - is defined as a U.S. citizen who identifies as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, or American Indian. All other Race/Ethnicity categories or Non-U.S. citizens are considered as a Non-Underrepresented Minority (Non-URM).

- **First generation** - is defined as a student who reported both parents as not receiving a baccalaureate degree. All other students are considered as Not First Generation

# Original Source Datasets (acquired via CSU Cico Instituional Research)

  - n = 78,229
  - Row contains record for each day that a student went to an SI session, and how many they went to in that day (Fall 2015 - Spring 2022)

# Data Preparation
## Student Level Analysis (n = 19,565)
* Only student records dated 2016 or later
* Only first-time freshmen
* Best attempt at isolating most recent student program record
* Approximately 35% of students in the programs dataset are not present in the profiles dataset. Therefore, these records have missing data for HS/Transfer GPA, one-year retention, and matriculation/graduation terms
* Records with missing data for the following attributes were dropped:
  - High School GPA
  - Attended Orientation Flag
  - STEM Major Flag
  - Full Time / Part Time Code
  - Academic Program

# Data Preparation
## Course Level Analysis (n = 5,637)
* Includes class size, average high school GPA, % first-gen in the class, % URM in the class, DWF rate, SI component flag, term year
  - These were calculated using the grades data provided by IR
  - Students with missing records for high school GPA were not included in the calculation
  - Students with missing records for URM and first-gen status were considered as not a member of these groups
* Course records from 2016-2019
* Course sections with less than 10 records of an SI visit during the semester were considered as sections without an SI-component
* Courses represented have a number less than 300 and are not a special number (x89, x99, etc.)
* To remove high calculated DWF outliers, class size >= 20

# Data Preparation
## Coarsened Exact Matching Analysis (n = 19,565)
* Student profiles, programs, and grades with course level information for courses with SI
* Only student records dated 2016 to 2019 who DID NOT DROP
* Best attempt at isolating most recent student program record
* Approximately 35% of students in the programs dataset are not present in the profiles dataset. Therefore, these records have missing data for HS/Transfer GPA, one-year retention, and matriculation/graduation terms
* Records with missing data for the following attributes were dropped:
  - High School GPA
  - Attended Orientation Flag
  - STEM Major Flag
  - Full Time / Part Time Code
  - Academic Program

# Student Level Analysis 

- Measuring student level equity gaps
  - Students who under represented minorities 
  - Students who are first generation
- Measuring success
  - One-year retention
- First time freshmen matriculated 2016 or later

# Student Level Analysis: Modeling 

- Logistic regression 
- Explanatory variables:
  - Student characteristics: URM, First Generation, Gender, Stem Major, number of units taken in the semester, number of units passed in the semester, Cohort term year, SI attendance 
  - Course characteristics: Academic level, Course fee existence, GE class

# Causal Inference 

![](pictures/causal_diagram2.png){#id .class width=50% height=50%}
- We want to measure the impact SI has on student performance.
- We need to control for these confounding variables!
- We can accomplish this by matching students with similar characteristics.

# How do we match?

- We can't match exactly!
- We coarsen our covariates (think binning). 
- We can now match exactly on our coarsened data.
- Lastly, throw out any unmatched observations

# Covariates for Matching 

- Notion: Good students go to SI, so the benefit is inflated.
  - High School GPA
  - Student Orientation Flag
  - Major Stem Flag 

- Demographics
  - Random Course ID
  - Academic Level
  - First Generation Flag
  
- Equity Gaps
  - URM/NonURM Flag
  - Gender Code

# Effect of SI in General

- After creating our matching, we fit a linear model to estimate the effect SI has on a students final grade.
- We find, after controlling for our confounding variables, SI improves students final grade by half of a letter grade.
- This doesn't address the question of whether or not SI reduces equity gaps.

# Limitations

- We have no data on student living situations.
- The Oroville dam flooding and Camp fire are not being accounted for.
- We are treating equity gaps separtely. 

# Next Steps

- Meet with an expert in Casual Inference.
- Can we extended Causal Inference Techniques to account for equity gaps?
- Can we put dollar amount on the benefit of SI by extending the results of the Casual Inference analysis.
