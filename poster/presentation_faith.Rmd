# Student Level Analysis 

- Measuring student level equity gaps
  - Students who under represented minorities 
  - Students who are first generation
- Measuring success
  - One-year retention

# Student Level Analysis: Modeling 

- Logistic regression 
- Explanatory variables:
  - Student characteristics: URM, First Generation, Gender, Stem Major, number of units taken in the semester, number of units passed in the semester, Cohort term year, SI attendance 
  - Course characteristics: Academic level, Course fee existence, GE class 
- Primary variables of interest: SI and the interaction between SI the measures of equity
