# ADS Project Instructions

Once you obtain a copy of this repo for your team, skim through the guidance docs then get together to discuss and fill out the items below. 


## Team roles
Here are some example roles that should be filled. You can add or adjust roles as you see fit anytime throughout the semester as long as everyone is clear _and comfortable_ with what their role is at the time. 

* **Oversight:** This person continually keeps the end goal in mind, making sure all work that is being done has a clear purpose that will work towards completing a milestone or end deliverable. This does not mean this person "approves/denies" work/tasks, but starts the "how will this help us achieve our goal" discussions. 


* **Taskmaster:** Github project board/issue organization. This person keeps track of the tangible "todo" list using github issues and/or the project board. They follows up if a task has been complete but not marked as closed. During team meetings this person also takes note of who is responsible for doing what, and makes sure there 

* **Liaison:** Who is the primary point of contact with the project scientist team (including Dr. D)? Do they cc all team members on every email or summarize information back to the team? This person also schedules either in person or zoom meetings with the science team as needed. 

* **Recorder/Timekeeper:** This person is in charge of writing regular updates to the class ADS page, periodically assess if milestones will be reached in the expected time, and keeps the project meeting notes (`project-notes.md`) clean. This does NOT mean this person is the 'secretary' and solely responsible for team meeting notes -unless agreed upon by the entire team. 


## Team collaboration agreements
What are your rules of engagement? How quickly should you expect responses from each other? Will you have regular meetings outside of class? What is your agreed upon main mode of communication? 


## Workflow
How will you use branches? What is the review process for PR's?

# Getting started

Your first task after setting roles will be to figure out what needs to happen first. What do you need to know and who do you need to know it from? Can you write down a clear deliverable and milestones? How do you want to approach this project? Review Dr. D's [calendar](bit.ly/DrD_calendar) and schedule a time for the group to meet with her to talk about these first steps.

## Best practices
* Be mindful of data sizes. Github does not like data files larger than approx 50Mb. Consider keeping the raw data in your local repo only by adding the names of the data files to the .gitignore
* Have clear workroles for using branches
* Use github issues and/or the project board to assign tasks to individuals. See reference links below. 
    - You can reference a task in a PR by putting the task number like #1 in the commit message. You can auto close a task with a PR by including "closes #1" in the commit message.
