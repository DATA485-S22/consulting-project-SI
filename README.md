# The impact of Supplemental Instruction on Equity Gaps at CSU, Chico

## Introduction
* Supplemental Instruction (**SI**) is designed to increase student success in historically difficult courses by utilizing peer-assisted study sessions. The SI leader has performed well in the course in a previous semester.

* An **equity gap** refers to differences in educational outcomes and student success across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, physical or mental abilities, and other demographic traits and intersectionalities.

## Workflow
**Before running any files, you must first download the data files from the secure Box folder and put them into a folder called "data" in the main project repository on your local system. This data is private and must not be seen by eyes not working on the project. After downloading and moving data, run the entire file "data_management.R".
