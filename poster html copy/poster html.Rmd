# Introduction

#### What is Supplemental Instruction?

  * Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a student lead homework session, where the SI leader is a student who has already received an A in the course. 
  * Students have diverse backgrounds, and some are not as prepared for college level material as others. SI aims bridge this gap, so every student has an equal opportunity at success.

# Future Work

  * Ideally, we want to identify attending SI as a treatment, and explore it's causal effect on equity gaps
