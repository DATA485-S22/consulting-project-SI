# Introduction

#### What is Supplemental Instruction? 

* Supplemental Instruction (SI) is designed to increase student success in historically difficult courses by utilizing peer-assited study session. The SI leader has performed well in the course.  


#### What is an Equity Gap?
* An equity gap  refers to differences in educational outcomes and student success across race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, physical or mental abilities, and other demographic traits and intersectionalities.

The impact of SI can be addressed at the class level or the individual student level. 
Here, we investigate both. We obtained data from CSU Chico Institutional Research. 
The data included course information, student demographics, and student course grades. We considered measures of success at both the student level and course. The methods for these different explorations are detailed below. 

### Student Level
*  The student level explores the success of an individual student. We are addressing the following questions:
  - Does SI have an impact on the one retention? 
  - Does the impact of SI differ between the equity groups? 

* We define student success as one year retention. This means the student was still enrolled one year from the course. 
* We limited our sample to first time freshman and General Education Courses. Figure 1 presents one year retention for those who did and did not attend SI by one of the measures of equity, URM. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="Less students attended SI overall, but there were fewer one-year drop-outs from students who attended SI.",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("pictures/fig1.png", "pictures/fig2.png"))
```
#### Course Level

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="caption",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("pictures/fig3.png"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,fig.cap="There is no clear relationship between DWF rate and Percentage of First Gen Students. This seems to be the case with courses with an SI component as well.",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("pictures/fig4.png"))
```

# Student Level Models

* Figure 5, presents the results from a model considering the first student level question, "Does SI have an impact on the one retention". The results from this model imply, that SI does not a have a significant impact on student one year retention. If the student is first generation is also insignificant. Additionally, this model also implies that a student that is classified as URM is positively related to one year retention. Figure 6, presents the results from a model considering the second student level question "Does the impact of SI differ between the equity groups". Again, SI attendance was found to be insignificant and URM is positively related. Additionally, if the student is an URM and attended SI, was also found to be insignificant. If the student is first generation is also found to be insignificant. However, if the student is first generation and attends SI the probability of year retention increases, and this relationship is significant. For both models, other covariates that may capture variation in one year retention were included in the model that are not presented here. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = "50%", fig.cap="caption",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("pictures/fig5.png", "pictures/fig6.png"))
```
  * Figure 3, presents the results from a model considering the first student level question, "Does SI have an impact on the one retention". The results from this model imply, that SI does not a have a significant impact on student one year retention. If the student is first generation is also insignificant. Additionally, this model also implies that a student that is classified as URM is positively related to one year retention. Figure 4, presents the results from a model considering the second student level question "Does the impact of SI differ between the equity groups". Again, SI attendance was found to be insignificant and URM is positively related. Additionally, if the student is an URM and attended SI, was also found to be insignificant. If the student is first generation is also found to be insignificant. However, if the student is first generation and attends SI the probability of year retention increases, and this relationship is significant. For both models, other covariates that may capture variation in one year retention were included in the model that are not presented here.

All estimates in the model are statistically significant (p-value << 0.001).

# Conclusions
The results from these initial models did not find significant results for our variables of interest. However, this could be due to underlying causes such as omitted variable bias. The following section describes additional work that may help us better consider our questions. 

# Future Work

  * Ideally, we want to identify attending SI as a treatment, and explore it's causal effect on equity gaps.
  * In order to accomplish this, we will employ Coarsened Exact Matching to control for counfounding variables. 
  * With this matching we can estimate the effect of SI on equity gaps with SI as a treatment as in a clinical trial.
